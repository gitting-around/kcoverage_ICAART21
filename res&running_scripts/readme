How to get the results from the Pignatta experiments:

1. Run handle_results.py for each case of each configuration. Cases that correspond to one configuration will be recorded as a separate 
row in the same csv file. 
for the static cases the metrics are (each cell in the row in the order below):
	Average time to get 1 agent covering a target
	Minimum time to get all the targets covered with 1 agent
	Average time to get k agent covering a target
	Minimum time to get all the targets covered with k agent

for the dynamic case (each cell in the row in the order below):
	Average k-coverage time per target
	Average amount of agents covering a target (per target)

This script can be run as follows:

        $ ./run_simulation.sh 3 3 7 reqresp/ 

which calls ./run_results.sh
which calls:

	$ ./handle_results.py no_agents no_targets sim_duration coverage static/dynamic"

2. Run get_violinplot.py, as follows: won't work with comm models data

	$ ./get_violinsnplot.py
	you will be asked of the value of k--> coverage, and the number of distinct configurations

2'. python3 ./get_boxplot.py
